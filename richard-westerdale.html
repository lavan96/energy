  <h1>Richard W. Westerdale II</h1>
  <p>Richard W. Westerdale II serves as our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors.
    Mr. Westerdale has over 30 years of experience in the energy industry. Mr. Westerdale previously served as
    Senior Vice President and on the Board of Directors for Jiangnan Environmental Protection Group Inc., or
    JNG, from 2018 until 2020. JNG is an international corporation that provides customized solutions,
    technologies and services for environmental air quality and emissions control. Prior to joining JNG,
    Mr. Westerdale was a Senior Advisor with the United States Department of State from 2011 to 2018 where
    he advised senior principals, including the Secretary, on the nexus of energy with U.S. national security and
    international energy policy priorities. Mr. Westerdale’s focus was on international energy affairs and their
    effect on U.S. business interests. Mr. Westerdale participated in the IEA Governing Board, was an Executive
    Director of the International Energy Forum and attended the G-7 and G-20 summits as a representative
    of the United States.</p>
    <p>Mr. Westerdale represented the Department in a variety of senior-level engagements, including bilateral
    and multilateral fora, and carried out official visits to advance international engagement, forge cooperation
    with partner-nations and establish agreements on a range of energy related initiatives.</p>
    <p>Mr. Westerdale previously worked for ExxonMobil for approximately nineteen years, last as part of a
    small staff group that reported directly to the Chairman and CEO. The team was responsible for ExxonMobil’s
    reserve replacement globally and streamlined the corporate approvals process to enable timely responses to
    market conditions. Prior to that, he held multiple other senior level positions at ExxonMobil, overseas in the
    Middle East and Australia. He gained extensive commercial and marketing experience by working with host
    governments and stewarding multi-cultural engagements. While in Abu Dhabi, his duties included initiation
    of commercial strategies, coordination of internal resources, and development of proposals that included
    competitive tender submissions as well as direct negotiations.</p>
    <p>While in Australia, Mr. Westerdale was responsible for overseeing marketing efforts into the Asia
    Pacific and developed the company’s first equity marketing strategy for LNG. Mr. Westerdale managed
    natural gas assets in Western Australia and represented ExxonMobil in multiple joint ventures, including
    leading the commercialization and economic development of the $6 billion Gorgon LNG project.</p>
    <p>Mr. Westerdale was also responsible for negotiating commercial agreements (joint venture governance
    and operating agreements) that facilitated resource monetization and worked closely with host governments
    to obtain necessary approvals to advance projects (i.e., Barrow Island access and royalty structure). He
    also led a team in evaluating an independent LNG marketing concept, including marketing strategies, which
    accounted for $30 billion of sales contracts into Asia Pacific that underpinned project development.
    Mr. Westerdale helped re-established ExxonMobil’s presence in Western Australia, by managing office
    expansion and staffing efforts.</p>
    <p>Prior to his tenure in Australia, Mr. Westerdale held a variety of positions in ExxonMobil’s downstream
    business, as well as engineering and sales assignments. From 2000-2001, Mr. Westerdale had full profit and
    loss responsibility for the New England Business Unit, which was a held separate company during the merger
    of Exxon and Mobil, with revenues of two billion dollars and a twenty-six percent market share. This
    included approximately 1,200 Mobil-branded dealer and distributor outlets in six states as well as distribution
    terminals and trucking in the region.</p>
